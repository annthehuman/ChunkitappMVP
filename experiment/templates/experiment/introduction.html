    <h1>Hi! Welcome to our study! </h1>
    <p>Thank you for taking your time to&nbsp;take part in&nbsp;our speech experiment. Please make sure that your earphones are plugged&nbsp;in (we&nbsp;kindly ask you to&nbsp;avoid using Bluetooth earphones) and click on&nbsp;the button below to&nbsp;proceed. The experiment will take around 30&nbsp;minutes, and you can take as&nbsp;many short breaks as&nbsp;you would like.</p>
